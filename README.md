# appManager

1- when I want to add new todo item button to the list view by addFooterView(View v) method app crashes
2- when I press add new item button app crashes and 
I think the problem is in todo_items_fragment_layout but I do not know where
3- when I want to save the time picker information in todoItemFragment in line 106-107
I get an error
